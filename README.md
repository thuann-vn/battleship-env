#EVA Hackathon Development Environment


## Steps to install

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose

Please install Docker Engine and Docker Compose at this [document](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

If you aren't familiar with Docker, please read the official documents.

2. Clone the repository

3. Build the image
    ```
    cd battleship-env
    docker-compose build
    ```

4. Test with the `random` bots

    `fig.sh` is just an alias of `docker-compose` command with an export `DOCKERHOST` variable.

    So please use this script instead of `docker-compose` to run the project.

    * Run
        ```
        ./fig.sh run -d
        ```

    * List the instances to confirm everything is working:
        ```
        ./fig.sh ps
        ```
    * Check logs
        ```
        ./fig.sh logs -f
        ./fig.sh logs -f bot1  # for bot1 only
        ```


4. Change the configuration to test your bot
    We already configured a random bot at `bot1` and `bot2`..

    So please use your bot in replacement for `bot2`, don't change the id values.

    * Edit the file `bot_urls.txt`
        Default, the value `DOCKERHOST` is already understood by gamengine to point to your local host.
        
        So just change the port value if your bot running on another port.
        
        Example: Your bot are running on `8080` port

        ```
        bot1,http://bot1:8000
        bot2,http://DOCKERHOST:8080
        ```
    
    * Use `local-bot.yml` instead of `docker-compose.yml`. 
        I already removed bot2 in `local-bot.yml`, so after editing the port in above step, just run:

        ```
        ./fig.sh -f local-bot.yml up -d
        ```

## Some docker/docker-compose commands

    > Note that, to running our project, please run `fig.sh` instead of `docker-compose`.

    ```
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up
    docker-compose up gameengine  # to run up gameengine
    docker-compose up -d  # to run in background
    docker-compose logs -f
    docker-compose logs -f bot1
    docker-compose stop
    docker-compose start
    docker-compose down
    ```
